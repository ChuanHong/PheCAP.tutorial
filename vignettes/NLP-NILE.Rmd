To generate NLP features, parse the EMR narrative notes to identify and count positive mentions of all CUIs in the dictionary using the [NILE](http://celehs.hms.harvard.edu/software/NILE/NILE_main.html). 

As an example, obtain the “Training: RiskFactors Complete Set 1 MAE” data under “2014 De-identification and Heart Disease Risk Factors Challenge” from the [i2b2 NLP Research Data Sets](https://www.i2b2.org/NLP/DataSets/Main.php). 

Use <a href="include/xml_Utils.java" download>xml_Utils.java</a> to extract notes from downloaded xml files. 

Then use the dictionary <a href="include/CAD_dict.txt" download>CAD_dict.txt</a> generated from MetaMap and parse these notes using NILE.

Results from processing the “Training: RiskFactors Complete Set 1 MAE” data can be found in <a href="include/NLP2014_set1_res.txt" download>NLP2014_set1_res.txt</a>.
